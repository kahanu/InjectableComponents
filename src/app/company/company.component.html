    <p>This demonstrates the use of Injectable Components from an array of components being injected into the view.</p>
    <p>The list of links on the left are generated from JSON data that could be returned from a database.
      When you click one of the items, the database data for that component will be displayed in the view.  Below the information about the app-company
      is a button group.  These buttons are dynamically generated from the list of dynamic components!
    </p>
    <p>When one of the buttons is clicked, it loads that component into the view dynamically!  And when another button is clicked,
        the component for that button will be displayed in that same position, with different content.</p>
        <p>It's important to understand a couple important points here:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Easy Maintenance</b> - the button group is generated from the list of dynamic components.  That means if you need to show some new content,
            like "Expenses", you just need to create the Expenses component, add it to the list of dynamic components, and the button will add itself.
          </li>
          <li><b>Any Content</b> - you'll notice that each of the components (Customers, Sales, Notary) contain different data and in different visual formats.  Each component does not
            have to be exactly the same as the others.  You can display anything you want.
          </li>
        </ol>
