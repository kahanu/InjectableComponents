<p>This is an Angular 4.x demo application that demonstrates how to implement dynamic components in your workflow.</p>
<h3>What are Dynamic Components?</h3>
<p>Dynamic components is a concept.  It's a way of instantiating one or more components (that already exists) and injecting them into another component on the fly. </p>
<h3>Why is this important?  </h3>
<p>We can already place a component directive in the HTML of another component.
  This is true, and this is absolutely useful, but what if you need to change the injected component with another component?
  You could use an <code>ngSwitch</code> statement, but that can lead to some maintenance.  The better option is to dynamically inject
components into a location in your view on the fly.</p>
<p>That's what this example will demonstrate.  You'll get a better idea of how this works when you run the demos.</p>
<h3>Demo Examples</h3>
<p>There are two demo examples of how you can use Dynamic Components in Angular.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Inline</b> - the <b>Companies</b> area demonstrates how to be able to display the content from several components via a button bar,
    where the content is shown on the page in a specific area.  This uses the ComponentFactoryResolver class to dynamically resolve the
  selected component and place it in a target HTML element.</li>
  <li><b>Dialog</b> - you can also display dynamic components in a modal dialog as shown in the <b>Suppliers</b> area.</li>
</ol>
