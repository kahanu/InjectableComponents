# InjectableComponents

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

This is a reference application that demonstrates how to dynamically inject components into the view.

You can see a working demo at [My Staging Site](http://www.mystagingsite.biz).

(As of Aug. 4, 2017 - NOTE: this almost works.  Throwing an error in the StatsComponent.  Trying to resolve the error.  A pull request is always accepted.)

(As of Aug. 5, 2017 - This displays data now when a button is selected thanks to [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45516705/angular-dynamic-component-injection-error/45518279#45518279), but it only display the content from the first button selected.)
