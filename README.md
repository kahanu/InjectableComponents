# InjectableComponents

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

This is a reference application that demonstrates how to dynamically inject components into the view.

You can see a working demo at [My Staging Site](http://www.mystagingsite.biz).

The Company and Suppliers are the launching point for the two scenarios.

## Company Demo
This demonstration shows how you can create a list of components that should be available to be displayed in a component and shown on the page when you click a button from the button group.

## Suppliers Demo
This is a slightly different demo but uses the same type of array of components to be used by another component, but this time when a button from the group of buttons is clicked, it launches a modal dialog with the selected component inside the dialog.

You'll see that there are many uses for either of these scenarios and it's much better than repeating code for all the necessary components you want to use.
